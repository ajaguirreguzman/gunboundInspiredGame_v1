# Gunbound-inspired game in Python

## Shor description

Gunbound-inspired game written in April 2011. Players use cannons to attack each other. Speed and angle of the projectiles are introduced anonimously. A (very strong) three is set in the middle of the battle field to avoid direct shots.

## Comments:

- Innumerable aspects of the interface can be improved (e.g., canvases remain on top of each other).
- An improved version is provided in Java.
- Commentary in Spanish (sorry!), must be translated.
